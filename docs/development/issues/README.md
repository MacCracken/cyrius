# Cyrius Issues — How to File

Active issue reports live here. Resolved items move to
[`archived/`](./archived/) — don't read archived/ looking for how
to file, read this.

## What belongs here

- **Consumer-reported bugs** — misleading errors, silent
  truncation, crashes, perf regressions found while porting or
  building a real project against Cyrius.
- **Stdlib surface recommendations** — "we keep re-rolling this
  twelve-line loop, should it be in `lib/*.cyr`?". See
  [`archived/stdlib-math-recommendations-from-abaco.md`](./archived/stdlib-math-recommendations-from-abaco.md)
  for the canonical example of a well-formed recommendation doc.
- **Design-gap reports** — a language or compiler behavior that
  worked around in consumer code with a clear stopgap, where the
  fix belongs in Cyrius.

## What doesn't belong here

- **Feature wishlists without a consumer stopgap.** Speculative
  language extensions go in `docs/development/roadmap.md` under
  "candidate themes", not here. The bar for an issue is: *someone
  is working around this in production code right now.*
- **One-line questions.** If it fits in a chat message, don't
  file it.
- **Upstream tool bugs.** If the bug is in GNU `ld`, `objdump`,
  the kernel, or libc — file it upstream. Cyrius issues are for
  Cyrius-side bugs.

## How to file

Create `docs/development/issues/{short-slug}.md`. Use
kebab-case. Include the consumer name if it's a specific
project (e.g. `bote-cirlf-injection.md`,
`abaco-mulmod-perf-gap.md`). Structure:

```markdown
# {title} — {short status}

**Status:** 🟡 **OPEN** — one line on why it is still open.
**Placement:** the release / arc it is pinned to, or "unpinned — 6.x-line backlog".
**Discovered:** YYYY-MM-DD during {context}
**Severity:** Low / Medium / High / Critical
**Affects:** cycc {version range}

## Summary

One paragraph. What breaks, what the symptom looks like.

## Reproduction

Minimal source, shell commands, expected vs. actual output.
If the repro needs a specific downstream repo, pin the commit.

## Root cause (if known)

File + line number. Speculation OK — flag it as speculation.
The Cyrius agent verifies or corrects.

## Proposed fix

Can be "none — just surfacing" if you don't know the internals
well enough. Don't block on this.

## Consumer-side workaround (if any)

If you've shipped a workaround, document it here so other
consumers can pick it up while waiting for the Cyrius fix.
```

## Severity guide

- **Critical** — silent data corruption, security (CVE-class),
  broken bootstrap, self-hosting regression.
- **High** — hard failure on a shipping consumer's build; no
  workaround available.
- **Medium** — hard failure with a known workaround, or silent
  perf regression > 2×.
- **Low** — misleading error messages, doc mismatches,
  ergonomic papercuts.

## Triage + lifecycle

The Cyrius agent reads new issues on-demand. Expect one of:

1. **Accepted for release X.Y.Z** — scope locked, shows up in
   `docs/development/roadmap.md` and in the target release's
   alpha series.
2. **Accepted, modified** — e.g. the abaco `u64_mulmod` triage
   took the alternative ("fast-path in `u128_mod`") over the
   original recommendation. Reason noted in the issue file.
3. **Declined** — with reason. See the `P3-1` DSP windows entry
   in the abaco triage for the canonical "nice-to-have but not
   stdlib surface" decline shape.

When the fix lands, the issue file:
- Gets a `— RESOLVED` suffix in its top heading.
- Adds a status paragraph pointing at the fix version + the
  CHANGELOG section that closed it.
- Moves to [`archived/`](./archived/).
- Gets a row in `archived/README.md`'s index table.

Filename stays stable across the move so external links keep
working.

## Status + placement lines (required, added at the v6.4.82 sweep)

**Every file in this directory carries a `**Status:**` line and a
`**Placement:**` line in its header block, ideally directly under the
`#` heading.** Before the v6.4.82 closeout sweep only two of eleven
did, which made open-vs-resolved unreadable at a glance and let a
shipped-but-still-framed-as-pending file sit in the queue.

Re-verified 2026-08-07 (v6.5.10): **17 of 17 have both.** The two that
did not — `2026-07-30-cx-backend-has-no-indirect-call.md` and
`2026-07-30-net-cyr-x86-only-socket-syscall-numbers.md`, both filed
cyrius-side in the older `**Filed:** / **Reporter:** / **Status:** open`
shape — gained theirs in that sweep. Check with:

```sh
for f in *.md; do [ "$f" = README.md ] && continue
  printf '%-72s %s %s\n' "$f" \
    "$(grep -c '^\*\*Status:\*\*' "$f")" "$(grep -c '^\*\*Placement:\*\*' "$f")"
done            # every row must read "1 1"
```

- `**Status:**` — `🟡 **OPEN** — <why, one line>`, and say **what you
  verified and when**, e.g. *"re-verified against live code at the
  v6.4.82 closeout: `X` still has zero callers."* A status that only
  restates the filing is worthless; a status that names a live check
  is what makes the next sweep cheap.
- `**Placement:**` — the release or arc it is pinned to (`v6.5.x — "IR
  substrate productionization"`), or plainly `unpinned — 6.x-line
  backlog`. Per CLAUDE.md, **every technical / codegen / runtime item
  lives in the 6.x line or the roadmap's "potential backlog" — nothing
  codegen is EVER parked to 7.x** (7.x = the language book + legal).
  Say "never 7.x" so the next reader does not have to re-derive it.

**Open-by-design is a real category.** An accepted filing that is the
acceptance record for a *pinned* arc stays open and un-archived until
the work ships — archiving is how we assert something is done, so
archiving an unbuilt requirement hides it from whoever opens the slot.
Say so in the Status line
(see [`2026-07-25-stiva-stackless-coroutines-interactive-exec.md`](./2026-07-25-stiva-stackless-coroutines-interactive-exec.md))
so a later rot sweep does not "clean it up".

## Re-triage rule (the rot sweep)

At every minor/major closeout the whole open queue is re-triaged.
**Verify each item's status against LIVE code — never against the
file's own claim.** Counts, line numbers and "N sites remaining"
figures in a filing go stale silently: the v6.4.82 sweep found one
file claiming 25 residual sites where a live grep said 7, and another
quoting a 27-of-248 test ratio that was really 30 of 251. Re-derive
the numbers, then write the command you used into the file so the next
sweep can re-run it.

**What the 2026-08-07 sweep (v6.5.10, 16 open) found, as the working
examples of each rot shape:**

- **Four files were fully SHIPPED and still framed as open** — all
  closed in the v6.5.7/.8 burst: `fmt-int-buf-i64-min`,
  `no-thread-detach…`, `distlib-has-no-all-profiles-mode`, and the
  already-corrected `coverage-corpus…`. This is the shape the rule
  exists for; four in one minor is the fastest it has ever accumulated.
- **Two files were PARTIALLY shipped** and read as wholly open:
  `agnos-syscall-peer…` (items 2 and 3 landed, item 1 correctly still
  waits on an agnos kernel arm) and `net-cyr-x86-only-socket-syscall-
  numbers` (its predicted collision *fired for real* at v6.5.7 and was
  closed by a mechanism the filing never proposed — the ≥1000
  private-alias band — while the filing's own core stayed open).
- **One file's prose contradicted its own header two screens above:**
  `ir-regalloc-rewrite-needs-reemit` carried a v6.5.2 header saying
  Wall 3 was closed and two later sections still asserting the
  SIGSEGV/hang it closed. **Run the thing rather than reading either.**
- **Line numbers drift even when the finding does not.** Every
  still-open file needed its `file:line` pointers re-derived; the
  findings themselves all survived.

Keep this directory a lean working queue (~10–12 files) — it is at
**16** open as of 2026-08-07 (plus 2 in `../proposals/`, 295 in
`archived/`), which is over. Archiving the four resolved files above
brings it to 13. Consolidate the P3 / "someday" tail into roadmap
entries rather than leaving issue files for it.

## Recommended security floor

When filing a consumer bug, report the Cyrius version you're on
AND the recommended minimum you'd need for the fix to deploy.
The current recommended floor is **v5.0.0** (cycc IR, cyrius.cyml
manifest); v5.0.1+ adds the alloc/vec overflow-guard hardening and
v5.1.0+ adds macOS Mach-O support (per CLAUDE.md's DO-NOT block).

## Pointers

- [`archived/`](./archived/) — resolved issues, indexed.
- [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) — shipped / planned releases.
- [`../state.md`](../state.md) — current cycle state (version, cycc size, in-flight slots).
- `../../../CHANGELOG.md` — source of truth for what each release
  actually shipped.
