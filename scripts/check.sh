#
# v5.9.1 (2026-05-06) — first slot of the v5.9.x sovereignty pass
# (bash-toolchain → cyrius). The dispatcher logic that used to live
# here (~743 LOC of bash) moved into cyrius. At v6.0.90 the monolithic
# programs/check.cyr (10.2K LoC) was split into programs/checks/
# (slim dispatcher main.cyr + per-suite files). This shim:
#   1. cd's to the repo root so child gates see the expected CWD,
#   2. builds build/cyrius_check on demand (mirrors the v5.8.44
#      auto-build pattern for build/cyrius_api_surface),
#   3. exec's the binary, propagating its exit code.
#
# scripts/lib/audit-walk.sh stays bash for the v5.9.x window — it
# is still consumed by the bash scripts/cyrius dispatcher, queued
# for cyrius conversion at v5.9.5 alongside that dispatcher. The
# fmt/lint walk logic was simultaneously ported into
# lib/audit_walk.cyr (cyrius stdlib module) for the check program's
# use; once scripts/cyrius converts, both audit-walk.sh and this
# bridge can retire together.
